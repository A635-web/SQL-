Difference Between Subqueries and Joins
Aspect	Subqueries	Joins
Purpose	Used to retrieve data based on conditions specified within the subquery.	Used to combine rows from multiple tables based on a related column between them.
Syntax	Enclosed within parentheses and can be used in different parts of a SQL statement.	Use explicit join keywords (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to specify how tables should be combined.
Result Set	Can return a single value, a list of values, or a result set containing multiple rows and columns.	Always produce a result set that combines columns from multiple tables based on the join condition.
Performance	Can be less efficient than joins, especially for large datasets or complex queries.	Generally more efficient for joining large datasets, as they allow for optimized query execution.
Complexity	Can make queries more complex and harder to understand, especially when nested deeply.	Can add complexity to queries, particularly with multiple tables and join conditions, but are generally easier to read.
Usage	Useful for filtering, aggregating, or manipulating data within a single SQL statement.	Essential for combining data from multiple tables based on related columns.
